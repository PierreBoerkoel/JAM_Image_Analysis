* Data acquisition
  - Immunohistochemistry  
  - Confocal microscopy
  - Post-acquisition image quality control & adjustment
    - Image intensity
    - Image orientation: Are the images right-side-up (RNFL at the top) and as horizontal as possible? (Layer not extending vertically)

* Data QA 
  - Is the data stored in a correct location? (i.e. Teamshare)
  - Is the data accessible by all study members? 
  - Is the data organized in the proper folder structure?  
  - Are all data named correctly and consistently? 
  
* Metadata
  - After the QA stage, create a master list of all data in the study, with a summary of n and unique eyes/subjects included.  
  - Confirm and record below for all data. Check for inconsistencies across data.    
    - tissue processing and imaging process
    - people who did the processing & imaging
    - imaging system 
    - imaging setting 
    - image resolution / magnification  
     
--------- After layer segmentation -----------
* Manual layer segmentation 
  - Are the layer segmentation image in the same orientation as the original image?
