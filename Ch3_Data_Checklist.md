* Data QA 
  - Is the data stored in a correct location? (i.e. Teamshare)
  - Is the data accessible by all study members?

  - After the QA stage, create a master list of all data in the study, with a summary of n and unique eyes/subjects included.  
  - Confirm and record below for all data. Check for inconsistencies across data.    
    - tissue processing and imaging process
    - people who did the processing & imaging
    - imaging system 
    - imaging setting 
    - image resolution / magnification
