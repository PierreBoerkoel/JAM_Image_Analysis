* Overview

  * Tissue: Alzheimer's & control retina, cross-section 
  * Imaging: 
    - [x] Immunohistochemistry  
    - [x] Confocal microscopy

  * Staining target (marker, colour): 
    * Microglia (IBA-1, green)
    * Nuclei (DAPI, blue) 
    * A-beta (BA4, red)

  * Data
    - [x] Image quality control 
    - [ ] Image naming correct? 
      - [ ] Sieun email image naming convention to Pierre
      - [ ] Pierre make sure naming correct 
    - [ ] Image access? Is everything there & properly organized? 
      - [ ] Eleanor copy volunteer-1 folder to inside the Brain Canada folder, and email me & Pierre, 
      - [ ] Joanne to email Jonathan for Pierre, Tyler to access the Brain Canada folder or alternative
      - [ ] Pierre check data organization
    - [ ] Image acquisition consistent, magnification, across diff. machines, person, etc.? - Pierre  
    * 5 AD eyes, 5 control eyes
    * Per eye - 8 images 
      * 4 in central 
      * 4 in peripheral
    * Processing was done twice: Set 1 - Geoffrey & Set 2 - Alis 
    * Imaging was done twice: Set 1 - Geoffrey & Set 2 - Alis
    * Image adjustment was done by: Set 1 - Tyler & Set 2 - Alis 
      
  * Analysis plan 
    1. load the image
    2. manual layer segmentation - Alis & Tyler 
      - [ ] Sieun to get images to convert to nifti (.nii) format
    3. apply layer segmentation to the image 
    4. threshold Red, Green, Blue /layer
    5. measure thickness /layer
    6. colocalization of Red & Green
