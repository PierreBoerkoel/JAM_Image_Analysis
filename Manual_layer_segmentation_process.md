1. Export .czi images (native Zeiss microscopy format) are exported into tif files.
   * Using Zeiss's Zen software  
2. Segment layers manually following the protocol
   * Using ITK-Snap using .nii files
   * (Protocol location here) 

Current process:
i. Alis exports the .czi images to .tif
iii. Alis manually segments the .tif files in ITK-Snap, upload to Teamshare, and let Sieun know. (The file organization & naming should be maintained)  
iv. Sieun uses the original and segmented images to do analysis
